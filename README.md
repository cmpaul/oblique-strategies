## History

In 1975, Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt created a deck of cards printed with aphorisms designed to be drawn at random for help breaking through creative blocks. (They've since gone through many iterations.)

In April of 2015, I ran across Kevin Lawler's [Prompts for Programmers](http://kevinlawler.com/prompts) and took it as a call to action. This Atom plugin is the result of that action.
